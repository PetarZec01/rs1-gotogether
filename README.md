#Go Togehter app

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

Our idea is to enable users to search for private rides/trips from one location to another and to create their own.
The user can choose the date they want to travel, the starting location, and the destination. Based on that, a list of drivers traveling on that route on the selected date will be displayed.
These are drivers who operate their own motor vehicles.
Additionally, our application allows users to publish their own rides.
The idea is that the user can create a ride by entering the date, departure time, starting location, final destination, possible stopovers for breaks, as well as the option for other passengers to join at those stops if there are available seats in the vehicle, the desired number of passengers, and the price per passenger.

**PROJECT GOAL AND PURPOSE**

The goal of this project is to make traveling easier for our users by providing a more flexible way to organize trips.
Users will not depend on fixed international/intercity transport schedules, allowing for shorter travel times and more interesting travel experiences while meeting new people.
Additionally, the other side of our application enables drivers to post their rides, which significantly reduces their travel expenses.
